# The documentation for Cobalt lives in /docs and is written in Sphinx.
# We have both static (written) documents (in docs/cobalt) and generated
# control files in docs/cobalt_modules.
# If the structure of Cobalt changes then we need to regenerate the
# control files which is what this script does. It is safe to run any time.

# Delete old generated files
rm docs/cobalt_modules/*
