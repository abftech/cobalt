# about: rebuild sphinx structure for documentation

# The documentation for Cobalt lives in /docs and is written in Sphinx.
# We have both static (written) documents (in docs/cobalt) and generated
# control files in docs/cobalt_modules.
# If the structure of Cobalt changes then we need to regenerate the
# control files which is what this script does. It is safe to run any time.

# Delete old generated files
rm docs/cobalt_modules/*

# Add warning
echo "Changed made here will be lost the next time cgit_doco is run" > docs/cobalt_modules/_DO_NOT_EDIT_THESE_FILES

# Get directories but exclude ones that aren't apps
APPS=$(ls -d */ | grep -v 'htmlcov|static|media|docs' | tr -d "/")

# We don't use the modules.rst or conf.rst file, but it doesn't seem that you can suppress it.
