Python for Pork Chops
=====================

If you have recently got involved in Cobalt, then before you start
carrying on like a pork chop, read this.

Cobalt is written in Django. Yes it could have been written in whatever
your favourite tool is but it's not. To understand this better you can read
the `ABF Technology Strategy <https://abftech.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/13795352/ABF%20Technology%20Strategy%20-%202019%20-%202021%20v1.0.pdf?api=v2>`_ which describes **why** Cobalt was built and
the `ABF Technology Strategy <https://abftech.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/13795352/ABF%20Technology%20Strategy%20Implementation%20-%202019%20-%202021%20v1.pdf?api=v2>`_
Implementation which describes the choice of tools.

Both of these are now somewhat out of date, but should give you at least an
overview of the thought processes.

If you aren't familiar with Django then it is recommended that you
read :doc:`django_for_porkchops`. This assumes you know Python,
if you don't then you should first read :doc:`python_for_porkchops`.
