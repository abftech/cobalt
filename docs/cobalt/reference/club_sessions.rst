==========================
Club Sessions Application
==========================

.. note::
    This page has the documentation on how to use this application
    (externally provided APIs etc). If you are looking for
    information on how it works internally, you can find that in :doc:`./club_sessions_support`.


--------------
Module Purpose
--------------

Club Sessions handles pre-paid sessions for clubs. It allows a director to upload player names
or manually enter them, and manage the payment side of club duplicate games.

This will likely change significantly when scoring is added.

--------------
External Usage
--------------

Club Sessions has no generally used external API calls. It is a standalone module.
