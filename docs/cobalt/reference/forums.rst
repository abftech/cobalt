====================
Forums Application
====================

.. note::
    This page has the documentation on how to use this application
    (externally provided APIs etc). If you are looking for
    information on how it works internally, you can find that in :doc:`./forums_support`.


--------------
Module Purpose
--------------

Forums simply handles blog posts and responses. We have discussion forums and
announcement forums.

--------------
External Usage
--------------

Forums handles the general blogging capabilities on Cobalt. This allows
users to communicate with each other, to comment on posts and for clubs
and other organisations to connect with their members and followers.

The codebase for Forums is relatively small and not too hard to understand
by reading the code.

There are no external API calls for Forums.

Forums uses RBAC for security. See :doc:`rbac` for more details.
