==========================
Results Application
==========================

.. note::
    This page has the documentation on how to use this application
    (externally provided APIs etc). If you are looking for
    information on how it works internally, you can find that in :doc:`./results_support`.


--------------
Module Purpose
--------------

Results displays the results from a game of bridge. Much of the UI component for the administration
part lives within the :doc:`./organisations`.

The two main parts are uploading and managing results files (administrators) and viewing
result files (end users).

--------------
External Usage
--------------

Results has no generally used external API calls. It is a standalone module.
