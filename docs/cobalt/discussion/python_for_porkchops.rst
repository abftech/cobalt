Python for Pork Chops (edit)
=============================

Do a course. Learn some basic things but don't get stressed about the advanced
things, you will learn them when you need them.

A lot of python developers work in data science so try not to go down a rabbit warren
of things you don't need to know as a Django developer.

Key Things to Learn
-------------------

Basic Structure
    No brackets, no endifs, no endfors, indentation is king

Everything is an Object
    You can use dir(my_variable) to see what something can do

Functions or Classes, You Choose
    Both functional and OO programming are equal partners, use what is right
    for the problem you are solving. If you have a bunch of related things
    then classes are probably the solution, if you every write a class with
    only one or two methods, it should probably be a function. Classes have
    overhead, functions don't.

Data Structures
    You need to understand things that can be changes and things that can't.
    Posh term is mutable and imputable. You need to understand lists, tuples
    and more complex structures.

Packages
    Python packages are pretty good (awesome if you haven't seen this in
    other languages). Before you build something, check if someone else has already
    done it.
