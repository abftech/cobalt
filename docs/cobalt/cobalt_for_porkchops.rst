Cobalt for Pork Chops
=====================

If you have recently got involved in Cobalt, then before you start
carrying on like a pork chop, read this.

Cobalt is written in Django. Yes it could have been written in whatever
your favourite tool is but it's not. To understand this better you can read
the `ABF Technology Strategy <https://abftech.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/13795352/ABF%20Technology%20Strategy%20-%202019%20-%202021%20v1.0.pdf?api=v2>`_ which describes **why** Cobalt was built and
the `ABF Technology Strategy Implementation <https://abftech.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/13795352/ABF%20Technology%20Strategy%20Implementation%20-%202019%20-%202021%20v1.pdf?api=v2>`_
Implementation which describes the choice of tools.

Both of these are now somewhat out of date, but should give you at least an
overview of the thought processes.

If you aren't familiar with Django then it is recommended that you
read :doc:`django_for_porkchops`. This assumes you know Python,
if you don't then you should first read :doc:`python_for_porkchops`.

Basic Architecture
==================

Cobalt tries to be as simple and basic a Django application as possible.
It uses Postgres (although there are no Postgres-specific features used
so it should work with any database backend). Each logical function has its
own application.

We use HTMX so there is no frontend framework to deal with. All of the frontend
HTML is generated by Django through the default template engine.

For the Australian Bridge Federation (ABF), Cobalt is deployed on AWS
Elastic Beanstalk. You will find some code relating to AWS within the Cobalt
code base, but you can deploy Cobalt on any platform that you like. The only
small exception to this is that Cobalt uses AWS Simple Email Service (SES) to
track emails. You can deploy Cobalt on any other platform and still use SES
or you can live without the tracking features.
