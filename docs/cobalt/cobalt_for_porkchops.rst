=====================
Cobalt for Pork Chops
=====================

If you have recently got involved in Cobalt, then before you start
carrying on like a pork chop, read this.

Cobalt is written in Django. Yes it could have been written in whatever
your favourite tool is but it's not. To understand this better you can read
the `ABF Technology Strategy <https://abftech.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/13795352/ABF%20Technology%20Strategy%20-%202019%20-%202021%20v1.0.pdf?api=v2>`_ which describes **why** Cobalt was built and
the `ABF Technology Strategy Implementation <https://abftech.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/13795352/ABF%20Technology%20Strategy%20Implementation%20-%202019%20-%202021%20v1.pdf?api=v2>`_
Implementation which describes the choice of tools.

Both of these are now somewhat out of date, but should give you at least an
overview of the thought processes.

If you aren't familiar with Django then it is recommended that you
read :doc:`django_for_porkchops`. This assumes you know Python,
if you don't then you should first read :doc:`python_for_porkchops`.

Basic Architecture
==================

Cobalt tries to be as simple and basic a Django application as possible.
It uses Postgres (although there are no Postgres-specific features used
so it should work with any database backend). Each logical function has its
own application.

We use HTMX so there is no frontend framework to deal with. All of the frontend
HTML is generated by Django through the default template engine.

For the Australian Bridge Federation (ABF), Cobalt is deployed on AWS
Elastic Beanstalk. You will find some code relating to AWS within the Cobalt
code base, but you can deploy Cobalt on any platform that you like. The only
small exception to this is that Cobalt uses AWS Simple Email Service (SES) to
track emails. You can deploy Cobalt on any other platform and still use SES
or you can live without the tracking features.

Tools
=====

With the ``utils`` application in Cobalt there are a number of tools that can help with
development activities. See :doc:`utilities_overview` for details.

- **cgit** is a set of tools for working with github and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- Inside the aws folder of utils you can find tools related to building environments on AWS

Quirks and Things to Know
=========================

Static Files
------------

Normally for a Django project you would add /static to .gitignore and run ``collectstatic`` as part of the
deployment process on each server. For Elasticbeanstalk with ``manifeststaticfilesstorage``
that will not work. You need to ensure that ``collectstatic`` is run within the development
environment as Elasticbeanstalk gives all files the same create date which means that
manifeststaticfilesstorage can’t tell which is the most recent one and doesn’t know which file to use.

FAQ
===

**Q**: I have looked at the code and bits of it don't match what the documentation says. How come?
**A**: The documentation reflects what we would like the code to look like and what we are building
going forward. There are still bits of code that were build in a different style (especially non-HTMX code)
which could be there for several years before they get re-done.
